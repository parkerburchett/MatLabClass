Looking at the graph the Y-Values break up into two parts. 

The first part is a function that when t[0,9]

From that you can simplify it so that the only value for a that makes that equation true is a=2

So for the first part y =2  * sqrt(t).

The second part you can infer from the points (9,6) and (12,0). This is just getting a line from two points. 

That equation looks like -1.5t +18 =y for x = (9,12).

The way to compute this in matlab is to break up the two parts of the graph into two t[] and y[] row matrices.

t1 =[0:.01:9]; // there are 901 values here
y1 = 2.*sqrt(t1);

you can see this by this function
plot(t1,y1);

The second part of the graph is 
t2 =[9.01:.01:12]; // 300 values you can start at 9.01 	
		   //since the value of y2 at y2(9) is 6 the same as it is for the first part of the graph
y2 = 24 - 2.*t2;

Now you just need to combine them into one graph. 
finT = [t1 t2];
finY = [y1 y2];

You can see the final graph here
plot(finT,finY)

At this point you just need to calculate rightRiemannSum(finT,finY).

Note: I am using 1201 rectangles to calculate this.

My answer was
	ans =
	    44.9996





_______________________________________________________
You can see the work by looking at this code after you save rightRiemannSum.mat in your working directory  :


%%% The first part of graph
t1 =[0:.01:9]; 
y1 = 2.*sqrt(t1);
plot(t1,y1);


%%% The second part of graph
t2 =[9.01:.01:12];
y2 = 24 - 2.*t2;
plot(t2,y2);

%%% add the parts together
finT = [t1 t2];
finY = [y1 y2];
plot(finT,finY)

%%% get the approx area under the curve

rightRiemannSum(finT,finY);
